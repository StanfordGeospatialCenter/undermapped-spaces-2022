# What is Co-coworking?

It can be hard to find time to make progress on digital projects. Through co-working, we will offer each other structure, community, and space to focus on new forms of scholarship and developing new skills...    

1. Everyone works on their stuff! Turn the camera on or off as you wish, make yourself comfortable.  
2. Have a question? Just speak up, or put it in the chat. Anyone who is in attendance can volunteer to talk with you about it. While folks are talking, feel free turn down your speaker OR listen in, and chime in if you want to with your own thoughts or questions. This is an environment where eavesdropping and butting in are encouraged! (Remember: use the breakout rooms to have multiple conversations or to work quietly.)
