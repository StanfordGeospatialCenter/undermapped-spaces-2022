# Small Group Instructions  

_We are running a little behind schedule, so please continue these conversations later on today!_

## 1. Introduce yourself 

Let folks know who and where you are, what you do, and your pronouns.  

## 2. Introduce your map  
What map did you select from the collections (your Zoom background map)?  Where does it fit in your project?  

What is a point of interest or detail on the map that gets you thinking? Why?  

What dilemmas, challenges, or opportunities does your map offer?  

Share your goals for the workshop with your group.  

## 3. Brainstorming    
If you haven’t yet had the chance to read about [Teaching Artifacts](../teaching-artifacts.md) on the Github page, check out that page now.  

As a brainstorming exercise, reflect on the problem/dilemma/challenge you’ve identified related to your maps.   
- What teaching/learning opportunities does this present?  
- What would you want students to take away from an activity with this map?  
- How might you do that?

Together, generate ideas about potential teaching artifacts you might create. Over the course of the week you will have the opportunity to workshop and adapt these ideas before sharing a write-up of your idea with your small group on Friday.   

## 4. Group communication and support  
How would your group like to communicate during the week? Co-working on Zoom? Slack? Email? WhatsApp? Google Docs?
