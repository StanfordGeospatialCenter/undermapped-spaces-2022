# Small Group Instructions  

Take 10-15 minutes as a group to talk about your thoughts for your teaching artifact. 

If you are feeling stuck:  
- what is a problem/dilemma/challenge youâ€™ve identified related to your map?  
- what teaching/learning opportunities does this present?  
what would you want students to take away from an activity with this map?  
- how might you do that?  

For the last 5-10 minutes, go around and share:  
1.) your intentions for this coworking session  
2.) questions or points of confusion about Moacir's workshop
