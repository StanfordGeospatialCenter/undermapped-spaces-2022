## 1. Pancakes & Silver: Historic Map Reading, Data Extraction
Monday, February 28, 2022
4:45 pm â€“ 6:00 pm

Pancakes & Silver, the 2019 ArcGIS StoryMap of the Year, is a demonstration in how to utilize digitized paper maps for interdisciplinary purposes: storytelling, data extraction, and data visualization. Along with telling the cartographic story of the Comstock Lode, a significant lode of silver ore discovered in Virginia City, Nevada in 1859, Pancakes & Silver is also an instructional guide in how to read maps for the purpose of extracting data. It then guides its readers in how to apply these data to create digital visualizations for expanded exploration and understanding.

**Andria Olson** is the map librarian at Branner Earth Sciences Library & Map Collections at Stanford University and provides instruction on ArcGIS StoryMaps for her community.
