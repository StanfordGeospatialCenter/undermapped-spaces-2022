# Teaching Artifacts  

## What is a teaching artifact?  
A **teaching artifact** is a discrete resource for use in a classroom or workshop.[^1] What form that takes is up to you! 

Some examples include:   
- in-class exercises or activities  
- handouts  
- lesson plans  
- slideshow/powerpoint presentations  
- set of questions pairs with a reading, video, podcast, etc  
- discussion prompt  

You will have the opportunity develop an artifact applying what you learn over the course of the workshop. You may propose a lesson plan for guiding students through a challenging topic or skill related to cartography Or perhaps you imagine a discusion prompt that asks students to consider the implications of existing methods, tools, and theories for the “Under-Mapped.” 

## Why teaching artifacts?  
We want to push back against the artificial divide between developing our skills as researchers and our skills as educators. Therefore, from the beginning of this workshop we want participants thinking about how advancing their digital humanities research skills can apply in the classroom. 

In addition to contributing to available digital resources, some of you may find it useful to include your teaching artifacts as part of your own teaching portfolios.  

## Expectations  
There is a lot of space for flexibility and creativity in imagining your teaching artifact.  Each artifact should:
1. engage some manner of map  
2. include a brief description of the artifact (100-250 words)  
3. connect somehow with the content of this workshop  

As part of our commitment to [openness](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/introduction/openness), we hope to compile your finished artifacts as part of the workshop's Github repository. 

## Projected Timeline
Over the course of the week, there will be designated times for your to share your ideas in small groups and provide feedback to one another. 

We know there is only so much one can do in a week, so your artifact could be more of a proposal or description of a resource you'd like to develop down the road.  

Your should submit your artifact and brief write-up on the last day of the workshop (Friday, Mar 4). Specific instructions for submission will follow.

I laid out a tableau on the desk at the front of class.

<img alt="Tweet thread  by Cate Denial @cjdenial continues: The ones facing me had to describe what they saw to the ones with their backs to me.  The ones with their backs to me had to draw what they were told to draw. We compared the pictures when everyone was done, and noticed that despite people all looking at the same still life, the drawings were very different.  The people facing me were the eyewitnesses to an event, I said, describing what they saw. The people with their backs to me were the historians, trying to analyze the primary source and interpret it to the best of their ability. We got into a conversation about perspective, bias, distance, time, skill, practice - you name it. All as a way of demonstrating what historians do.  Thank you @Think_History!  It's such a great activity!" src="assets/teaching-artifacts-8820ffed.png" width="" height="" >
