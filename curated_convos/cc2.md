### Activity

Imagine you have the following dataset for a project. Read the descriptions below and consider how you might go about visually exploring this dataset. The questions below are for breakout groups, then we will come together to create some charts, graphs, and maps together. 

#### Vesuvius dataset

Some Mt Vesuvius facts:
- Mt Vesuvius is a volcano in Southern Italy, in the outskirts of Naples.
- It's the only volcano to have erupted in mainland Europe in the last hundred years; its last eruption was in March 1944.
- In AD 79 there was a devastating eruption that destroyed Pompeii, described in 2 letters by Pliny the Younger. 
- Vesuvius is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanos in the world, because... 
  - it's the most densely populated volcanic region in the wold with 3 million people living nearby
  - it has a tendency toward violent, sudden explosions of the Plinian type, named for Pliny's description of Vesuvius
- Harvard connections: In the 1800s, there was a guestbook where people climbing Mt. Vesuvius could sign their names. One particular guestbook, active from 1826-1829, ended up in Houghton Library, where a historian transcribed quite a few lines from the guestbook by hand. This data has since been cleaned even further for easier visualization.

#### Data Dictionary

| Co-ordinates longitude | Longitude of origin city or state | |

#### Group Questions
- Which variables are you most interested in exploring?
- What questions do you have about those variables?
- Can you think of a way/ways to begin to visually answer those questions? E.g., make a map showing how many people climbed Vesuvius from each Nationality; a chart (specify which kind) showing the how many climbers were men vs women, etc.
