### Public Lecture 1    
**Pancakes & Silver: Historic Map Reading, Data Extraction**  
Monday, February 28, 2022  
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm PST  

Pancakes & Silver, the 2019 ArcGIS StoryMap of the Year, is a demonstration in how to utilize digitized paper maps for interdisciplinary purposes: storytelling, data extraction, and data visualization. Along with telling the cartographic story of the Comstock Lode, a significant lode of silver ore discovered in Virginia City, Nevada in 1859, Pancakes & Silver is also an instructional guide in how to read maps for the purpose of extracting data. It then guides its readers in how to apply these data to create digital visualizations for expanded exploration and understanding.  

**Andria Olson** is the map librarian at Branner Earth Sciences Library & Map Collections at Stanford University and provides instruction on ArcGIS StoryMaps for her community.

### Public Lecture 2  
**"If Englande crie out, this Norumbega offreth the remedie": American Imaginaries after Cartography**  
Tuesday, March 1, 2022  
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm PST  

Richard Hakluyt's early modern propagandizing for English colonization in North America depended on the availability of printed matter: maps, narratives, and images. Using the 2018 French historical graphic novel Florida by Jean Dytar and its depiction of Hakluyt, Sá Pereira considers the imaginary that the novel's geographical history creates. Yet in 2022, after the various spatial turns, can we even speak of an American imaginary outside of the rigid forms of the cartographic ideal?

**Moacir P. de Sá Pereira** is the Research Data Librarian at Columbia University Libraries.

### Public Lecture 3  
**Community ownership and open data: where is the balance?**  
Wednesday, March 2, 2022  
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm  

Open data is integral to the work of scholarship, but openness can easily turn into an extractive exercise that enforces exploitative dynamics. What considerations do people working with open data have to take into account while working with open spatial data?

**Majd Al-Shihabi** is a technologist and urban planner, and a PhD student in the geography department at the University of Toronto. Majd's current research is on the use of agent-based modelling to address the wicked problem of the housing crisis, and is the co-founder of Palestine Open Maps.
