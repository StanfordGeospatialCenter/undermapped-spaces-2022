### 1. Pancakes & Silver: Historic Map Reading, Data Extraction
Monday, February 28, 2022
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm PST

Pancakes & Silver, the 2019 ArcGIS StoryMap of the Year, is a demonstration in how to utilize digitized paper maps for interdisciplinary purposes: storytelling, data extraction, and data visualization. Along with telling the cartographic story of the Comstock Lode, a significant lode of silver ore discovered in Virginia City, Nevada in 1859, Pancakes & Silver is also an instructional guide in how to read maps for the purpose of extracting data. It then guides its readers in how to apply these data to create digital visualizations for expanded exploration and understanding.

**Andria Olson** is the map librarian at Branner Earth Sciences Library & Map Collections at Stanford University and provides instruction on ArcGIS StoryMaps for her community.

### 2. American Imaginaries after Cartography
Tuesday, March 1, 2022
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm PST

_"If Englande crie out, this Norumbega offreth the remedie": American Imaginaries after Cartography_

Richard Hakluyt's early modern propagandizing for English colonization in North America depended on the availability of printed matter: maps, narratives, and images. Using the 2018 French historical graphic novel Florida by Jean Dytar and its depiction of Hakluyt, Sá Pereira considers the imaginary that the novel's geographical history creates. Yet in 2022, after the various spatial turns, can we even speak of an American imaginary outside of the rigid forms of the cartographic ideal?

**Moacir P. de Sá Pereira** is the Research Data Librarian at Columbia University Libraries.

### 3. Community ownership and open data: where is the balance? 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm

Open data is integral to the work of scholarship, but openness can easily turn into an extractive exercise that enforces exploitative dynamics. What considerations do people working with open data have to take into account while working with open spatial data?

**Majd Al-Shihabi** is a technologist and urban planner, and a PhD student in the geography department at the University of Toronto. Majd's current research is on the use of agent-based modelling to address the wicked problem of the housing crisis, and is the co-founder of Palestine Open Maps.

### 4. Mapping the Gap: Intersections, Counter-Surveillance...
Thursday, March 3, 2022
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm

Be it due to lack of training, censorship or differences in infrastructure, not everyone in the world has access to mapping, despite the accessibility of off-the-shelf tools online. At the same time, the possibilities and challenges for mapping grow as we become increasingly aware of the gaps in the historical and cultural record, and the question of mapping absence takes center stage in mapping and scholarly communities. In this lecture, Alex Gil will thread through a selection of web visualizations and maps in order to shed light on the conditions for cartographic creativity in an uneven, broken world.

**Alex Gil** is the Digital Scholarship Librarian at Columbia University, where he collaborates with faculty, students and library colleagues in humanities research, pedagogy and knowledge production that involves the use of advanced computation, digital media design, and network technologies. He is the lead coordinator for the [Butler Library Studio](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University Libraries, a tech-light library space focused on digital scholarship and pedagogy, and now a broadcast, [Studio Remote](https://www.twitch.tv/culstudio). He is also co-founder and moderator of [Columbia’s Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/), a trans-disciplinary research cluster focused on experimental humanities; one of the creators and main editors of [_archipelagos journal: a journal of Caribbean digital praxis_](http://archipelagosjournal.org/), and co-wrangler of its sister conference series, [The Caribbean Digital](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/).
