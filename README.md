# Under-Mapped Spaces: New Methods and Tools for Critical Storytelling

- [Description](##--Description)  
- [Public Lectures](##-public-lecture-series)  

## Description
Even as scholars move to redress white supremacy, we lag in engagement with the histories of “under-mapped” spaces. This is a product of historical conditions and contemporary inequalities in the global production of knowledge. This workshop presents the opportunity for diverse students from different disciplines to critically consider the politics of cartographic invention and engage in urgent discussions that link historical practice with digital development. Sessions will also address the pedagogical implications of digital cartography and best practices for incorporating critical storytelling with maps in classrooms and public spaces.

We introduce the neologism “under-mapped” to denote underexplored gradations in cartographical information. Drawing on critical theorists and practitioners of counter-mapping, we understand "under-mapped" places to be:
- _Under-served_: cartographic content corresponds with a lack of affluence and political influence of corresponding communities;
- _Under-valued_: cartographic content prioritizes legibility in service of state surveillance and capitalist resource extraction;
- _Under-engaged_: cartographic content relies on outsider observations without engaging in collaborative knowledge creation.

### 1. Pancakes & Silver: Historic Map Reading, Data Extraction
Monday, February 28, 2022
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm PST

Pancakes & Silver, the 2019 ArcGIS StoryMap of the Year, is a demonstration in how to utilize digitized paper maps for interdisciplinary purposes: storytelling, data extraction, and data visualization. Along with telling the cartographic story of the Comstock Lode, a significant lode of silver ore discovered in Virginia City, Nevada in 1859, Pancakes & Silver is also an instructional guide in how to read maps for the purpose of extracting data. It then guides its readers in how to apply these data to create digital visualizations for expanded exploration and understanding.

**Andria Olson** is the map librarian at Branner Earth Sciences Library & Map Collections at Stanford University and provides instruction on ArcGIS StoryMaps for her community.

### American Imaginaries after Cartography
Tuesday, March 1, 2022
4:45 pm – 6:00 pm PST

_"If Englande crie out, this Norumbega offreth the remedie": American Imaginaries after Cartography_

Richard Hakluyt's early modern propagandizing for English colonization in North America depended on the availability of printed matter: maps, narratives, and images. Using the 2018 French historical graphic novel Florida by Jean Dytar and its depiction of Hakluyt, Sá Pereira considers the imaginary that the novel's geographical history creates. Yet in 2022, after the various spatial turns, can we even speak of an American imaginary outside of the rigid forms of the cartographic ideal?

**Moacir P. de Sá Pereira** is the Research Data Librarian at Columbia University Libraries.
