# Workshop 1
## A beginners guide to web mapping: vocabulary, tools and possibilities  
with Alex Gil on [day 1](../day1.md)  

**Before the workshop,** find a digital map that helped you understand something you didnâ€™t before. 

Ask yourself:  
- How was this built?  
- Who built it?  
- Using what tool(s)?  
- How long did it take to build?
