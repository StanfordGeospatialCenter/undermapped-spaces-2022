# Under-mapped Spaces: New Methods and Tools for Critical Storytelling
 
In this five-day, intensive interdisciplinary workshop for emerging scholars, we aim to promote exploration of Stanford’s cartographical collections and test the utility of digital tools in the creation of compelling, accessible narratives of “under-mapped” places. The workshop will be held February 28 to March 4, 2022 and engage at least twelve late-stage graduate students and recent PhDs.

Even as scholars move to redress white supremacy, we lag in engagement with the histories of “under-mapped” spaces. This is a product of historical conditions and contemporary inequalities in the global production of knowledge. This workshop presents the opportunity for diverse students from different disciplines to critically consider the politics of cartographic invention and engage in urgent discussions that link historical practice with digital development. Sessions will also address the pedagogical implications of digital cartography and best practices for incorporating critical storytelling with maps in classrooms and public spaces.

We introduce the neologism “under-mapped” to denote underexplored gradations in cartographical information. Drawing on critical theorists and practitioners of counter-mapping, we understand "under-mapped" places to be:
- _Under-served_: cartographic content corresponds with a lack of affluence and political influence of corresponding communities;
- _Under-valued_: cartographic content prioritizes legibility in service of state surveillance and capitalist resource extraction;
- _Under-engaged_: cartographic content relies on outsider observations without engaging in collaborative knowledge creation.
