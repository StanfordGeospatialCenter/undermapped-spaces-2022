# Partner Map Collections  

Participant projects center on cartographic materials sourced from two extraordinary collections at Stanford University, the [Branner Earth Sciences Library](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/branner/about) and the [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/).   

### David Rumsey Map Collection
The David Rumsey Map Collection was started in the mid 1980s and contains more than 150,000 maps. The collection focuses on rare 16th to 21st century maps of North and South America, the World, Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania. The collection includes atlases, wall maps, globes, school geographies, pocket maps, books of exploration, maritime charts, and a variety of cartographic materials.

Via [Searchworks](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/xh235dd9059), you can learn more about this collection and find a map that interests you. Rumsey has made open access a priority on the [collectionâ€™s website](https://www.davidrumsey.com/), where you can download high resolution ready for georeferencing and creative play.  

### Branner Earth Sciences Library & Map Collections
The Branner Earth Sciences Library & Map Collections houses resources to support the departments in the School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences with topics covering geology, seismology, energy resources engineering, environmental science, geophysics and geochemistry. The library also houses the main map library and GIS support services. The library is a depository for the United States Geological Survey and offers collections that span the globe.
